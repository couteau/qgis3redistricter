# qgis3redistricter
Redistricting for QGIS v3.

Full install and instructions for use are available at https://www.qgisredistricting.com

# Known issues
- Creating a second plan on the same file will overwrite the first plan
- Plugin crashes if closed improperly: if you need to keep using it and this happens, restart QGIS (sorry, it's annoying)

# Future features
- Second population field on the crosstab export
